# Country_Recipe_Classification-Random-Forest

## Overview
This project focuses on classifying recipes based on the country of origin using a Random Forest classifier. Cuisine classification based on ingredients is an interesting and challenging task in machine learning. This project aims to develop a Random Forest model to predict the country of origin for a given recipe based on its list of ingredients.

## Introduction
Cuisine classification is a fascinating task that involves identifying the country or region of origin based on the ingredients used in a recipe. This project uses a Random Forest classifier to analyze and classify recipes into their respective countries, leveraging the unique ingredient combinations associated with each cuisine.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of recipes from various countries, each labeled with its corresponding cuisine. It includes information on the ingredients used, allowing the model to learn patterns and associations to classify recipes accurately.

## Results
The model's performance on the test set is as follows:

Accuracy: 70%  
Precision: 62%  
Recall: 70%  
F1 Score: 65%
